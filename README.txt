This repository is a collection of side projects that I’ve built over time. Some are small experiments, others are more complete, but all are part of my ongoing effort to learn new things. 

Projects are organized in separate folders, and I’ll continue adding more as I go. Each subdirectory contains a separate project with its own code and, if needed, a README explaining its purpose or setup.

Anyone is free to use, copy, or build on the code in this repo, no need to ask for permission.
