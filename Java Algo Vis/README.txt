Main is in sortVisualizer.java. The only sorting algos avaliable are
- Bubble sort      - Insertion sort
- Merge Sort       - Quick Sort

On line 9 of sortVisualizer.java you can change the amount of elementsthat will be generated and sorting. 

Once loaded the slider indicates the amount of delay, further left is no delay (reaching 0ms),
further right is more delay (reaching 100ms). These delays occur multiple times within any given thread
so its not a overall delay but closer to a delay per action.
