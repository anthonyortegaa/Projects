Not the most accurate but works decently, just make sure you have the path the the vosk model 
properly inputed and try to have the audio close to whatever mic you are using.

The transcripting appears in the terminal as it logs speech but it all gets saved onto the 
speechToText.txt file. 

Every time you start a new recording it will ask if you want to start a  new transcription, 
if you say yes then it will wipe speechToText.txt and write onto it, if you say no it just 
starts writing onto speechToText.txt from where you left of.
