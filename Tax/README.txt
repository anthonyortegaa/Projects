This is a document read that parses through monthly bank statements. I bank with citi, at least at the
time I am writing this I do, so it follows their formating for statments. 

It will read through all the statments added to a folder (paste folder path onto line 54) then look for transaction names, 
example : UBER , MTA , NETFLIX , and then add cost of all the transactions made with those transaciton names. 
You could scan one file at atime, but it is built to scan everything at once. 

Mainly use this to see how much I've spent on things like train fare, uber eats, doordash, and so on.
